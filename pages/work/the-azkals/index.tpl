        <p>
          Locally known as &quot;Azkals&quot;, the Philippine national football team aims to reinvigorate the Filipino's interest towards football since it lags behind other major sports in the country. I was tasked to design the website that will help newcomers be acquainted with the team as well as make passionate fans feel at home. Working closely with The Azkals Foundation, we collaborated to put a spotlight on the team so they can make the Filipinos proud.

          The site featured a news section where fans can receive updates about the team, an about section where newcomers can read about the history of The Azkals as well as information on the current team roster. In addition to that, a fan area was made so avid followers of the team can upload photos of them with their favorite members. We also added a store where fans and newcomers can buy Azkals merchandize.
